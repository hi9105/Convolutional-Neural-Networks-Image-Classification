### Overview <a name="overview"></a>

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)! In this project, I have build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, my algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed. The goal is to classify images of dogs according to their breed. The algorithm that detects humans in an image is different from the CNN that infers dog breed.

### Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

### Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2020 to better understand:

1. What are the most wanted languages for next year 2021 ?
2. How is total compensation (USD) correlate to developer type ?
3. Which country has the highest average total compensation (USD) ?
4. How well can we predict an individual's age ? What aspects correlate well to age ?

The full set of files related to this course are publicly available here. You can see whole analysis here.

### File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. The notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

### Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@Shiv_Shiv/what-should-you-do-to-earn-more-694638341f51).

### Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Stack overflow link available [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/). Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
