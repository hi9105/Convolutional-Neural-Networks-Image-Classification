### Overview <a name="overview"></a>

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)! In this project, I have build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, my algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed. The goal is to classify images of dogs according to their breed. The algorithm that detects humans in an image is different from the CNN that infers dog breed.

### Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*. 

A requirements file is also available for reference.

### Dataset Description <a name="files"></a>

1. There are 133 total dog categories.
2. There are 8351 total dog images.
3. There are 6680 training dog images.
4. There are 835 validation dog images.
5. There are 836 test dog images.

There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related. The notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

The file "Report.pdf" contains project full report.

The best model gives approx. 79% of accuracy. It performs well on almost all dog images. The outputs for human images are also convincing.

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available at [Medium blog post](https://medium.com/@Shiv_Shiv/check-out-your-face-resembles-which-dog-breed-a49caaae42).
